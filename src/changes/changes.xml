    <!-- release plan: 
      - eliminate warnings: 
        type parameter E is hiding the type E is because of methods toArray. 
        This seems to be just a bug in vscode java extension. 
      - in general, the path is eliminating code from this package in favor of more widely known code. 
      - Benchmarker: maybe method snap() shall be removed 
      - Benchmarker: there is a way to record heap memory and non-heap memory separately.
